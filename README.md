# Project 1: Classifying fraudulent detection of credit card: Project Overview
In this project, the primary focus is to perform Classification on fraud of credit card, by analysing whether the transaction is a fraud or a genuine payment and four classification technique are performed and compared between fraud and non-fraud payment of credit card by applying logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors algorithm, support vector machines algorithm and decision tree algorithm. Covering Splitting process, Imbalance class problems, Random Under-sampling, distribution and correlating, and Anomaly detection by implementing different techniques of data preparation. All the algorithms and techniques were performed in Python programming language with the help of Machine learning repository. As the dataset is imbalance, we need to balance fraud and non-fraud transactions, visualize it in the form graph and get the best accuracy.
